# Naive Bayes
A Naive Bayes classifier is a probabilistic machine learning model that’s used for classification task. The crux of the classifier is based on the Bayes theorem.
The “Naive” part of the name indicates the simplifying assumption made by the Naïve Bayes classifier. The classifier assumes that the features used to describe an observation are conditionally independent, given the class label.

This gives the probability of A occuring after assuming that B has occured.
