# Naive Bayes
A Naive Bayes classifier is a probabilistic machine learning model that’s used for classification task. The crux of the classifier is based on the Bayes theorem.
The “Naive” part of the name indicates the simplifying assumption made by the Naïve Bayes classifier. The classifier assumes that the features used to describe an observation are conditionally independent, given the class label.

This gives the probability of A occuring after assuming that B has occured. 
## Applying Bayes Theorem Equation in Algorithm
P(A|B) is the posterior probability of class (target) given predictor (attribute).
P(B) is the prior probability of class.
P(B|A) is the likelihood which is the probability of predictor given class.
P(A) is the prior probability of predictor.
